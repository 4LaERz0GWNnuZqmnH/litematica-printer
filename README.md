# Litematica-Printer

## Setup

To set this up just add the latest litematica version to your mods folder as well as this, it will replace easy place with printer. This does not use accurate placement protocal and therefore means that in order to place blocks in some rotations, you need to rotate your player. If I stop lazy, I will add one that does use accurate placement.
